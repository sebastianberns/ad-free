These user styles are a simple hack that ensure the same and improved functionality.

- Chrome built-in user styles
- URL specific rules

#### Installation
1. Download folders
2. Go to chrome://extensions/
3. Activate developer mode
4. Click `Load unpacked extension…` and add downloaded folders one by one


#### Notes
Only works in Chrome.

This obviously doesn’t remove any ads from any site (they’ll still be loaded), but simply hides them using CSS.
